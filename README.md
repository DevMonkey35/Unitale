#Unitale - Lua moddable Undertale engine + Will be UniWord

##Required files

To be able to run Unitale you'll need the default Undertale assets. The default Undertale assets are by Toby Fox (http://www.undertale.com) and used with permission.
The files from this .zip should be unpacked to the Assets folder of the project.

##Licenses

Unitale is released under the GNU General Public License 3.0.
We are using MoonSharp as our Lua interpreter, written by Marco Mastropaolo. The binary is included in /Assets/Plugins. License details in MOONSHARP_LICENSE.

Actually this is lvk's license. It is not mine. And I don't know how to add licenses...
